Stability Analysis in Spacecraft Engineering

🚀 Introduction
This project explores how key physical parameters—friction, gravity, angle of approach, and applied force—affect the stability of spacecraft during critical operations like re-entry, landing, or docking.

📦 Project Overview
Goals
Explore the effects of friction, gravity, angle, and force on stability.
Demonstrate optimization strategies for aerospace engineering.
Provide an educational tool for understanding spacecraft dynamics.
Capabilities
Simulate Earth and Moon landing scenarios.
Dynamically calculate a stability score.
Visualize and explain stability results in real time.

Run the notebook cells to initialize the simulation.

📊 How It Works
Stability Score Calculation
The stability score is calculated based on the interplay of four parameters:
Friction: Resistance during motion, simulating surface types.
Gravity: Gravitational pull, representing different celestial bodies.
Angle of Approach: Trajectory angle, affecting landing dynamics.
Force: Thrust or impact force during motion or landing.

The formula used is:
python
Copy code
stability_score = friction * gravity * angle * force

Interactive Widgets
Adjust sliders for each parameter to see how the stability score and its explanation change dynamically.

🌌 Real-World Applications
Earth Landing Scenario
Gravity: 9.81 m/s²
Friction: 0.1–1.0 depending on surface conditions.
Angle: Typically 5°–10° for controlled re-entry.
Force: Hundreds to thousands of Newtons depending on craft size and speed.
Moon Landing Scenario
Gravity: 1.62 m/s²
Friction: Low due to lunar regolith.
Angle: Shallower approaches due to reduced atmospheric drag.
Force: Lower than Earth due to reduced gravitational pull.

💡 Features and Insights
Friction
Low (e.g., icy surfaces): Reduces stability during landings.
High (e.g., rubber-like materials): Increases stability but may cause energy losses.
Gravity
Earth (9.81 m/s²): Standard stability analysis.
Moon (1.62 m/s²): Requires reduced force for landings.
Angle of Approach
Shallow (<15°): Safer but extends landing time.
Steep (>45°): Risky but efficient for precision landings.
Force
Low (<500 N): May fail to counteract gravity.
High (>2000 N): Effective but risks instability.
